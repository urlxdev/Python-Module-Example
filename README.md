# pyURLx Example  
This is a simple GUI application built with Python and Tkinter that allows you to shorten long URLs using the "pyURLx" module. The shortened link is then displayed in the application, and you can easily copy it to your clipboard with the click of a button. 

## Prerequisites   
Before running the application, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the "pyurlx" module, which is used for link shortening.

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:  
`pip install pyurlx`
## How to Use  
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.  

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the code.  

Run the link_shortener.py script using Python:  


`python link_shortener.py`  
The GUI window will open, displaying two input fields and two buttons.  

Enter the long URL that you want to shorten in the "Long URL" input field.  

Click the "Shorten" button. The application will use "pyURLx" to shorten the link and display the shortened URL in the "Short URL" input field.  

To copy the shortened URL to your clipboard, click the "Copy Link" button.  

You can repeat the process with different URLs as needed.  

## Error Handling
The application includes basic error handling for common issues that might arise during the link shortening process. If an error occurs, a pop-up message box will display the specific error message.
